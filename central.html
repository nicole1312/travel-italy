      <h1>Central Italy</h1>
      <p class="description">
        Rome ( Italian:Roma), the Eternal City, is the capital and largest city
        of Italy and of the Lazio region. It is famous for being the home of the
        ancient Roman Empire, the Seven Hills, La Dolce Vita (the sweet life),
        the Vatican City and Three Coins in the Fountain. Rome, as a
        millennia-long center of power, culture (having been the cradle of one
        of the globe's greatest civilisations ever) and religion, has exerted a
        huge influence over the world in its roughly 2800 years of existence.
        The historic centre of the city is a UNESCO World Heritage Site. With
        wonderful palaces, thousand-year-old churches, grand Romantic ruins,
        opulent monuments, ornate statues and graceful fountains, Rome has an
        immensely rich historical heritage and cosmopolitan atmosphere, making
        it one of Europe's and the world's most visited, famous, influential and
        beautiful capitals. Today, Rome has a growing nightlife scene and is
        also seen as a shopping heaven, being regarded as one of the fashion
        capitals of the world (some of Italy's oldest jewelry and clothing
        establishments were founded in the city). With so many sights and things
        to do, Rome can truly be classified a "global city".
